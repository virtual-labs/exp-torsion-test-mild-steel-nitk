1. What do you mean by modulus of rigidity?
2. Define modulus of rupture?
3. How the angle of twist is measured in this test?
4. Why does the brittle material fails in helicoidal shape and ductile material shears on right section under torsion load?
5. What are the different failure modes of the specimens?
